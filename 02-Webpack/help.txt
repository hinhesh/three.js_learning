Pb : 
- Loading Tree.js with a script is too heavy 
Res : We need to run a server to emulate a website for security reasons

__> Bundler : A tool in which you send JavaScript, CSS, HTML , images, TypeScript etc
 & used as a local server, manage dependencies
--> > We use webpack as a bundle : https://webpack.js.org/

1) Install Node.js
Unzip 04webpack
Replace the src by ours
2) In the starter file run : 
	npm install (it will install the dependencies in the package.json )
then npm run dev
Your browser should open with an URL Looking like http://192.168.1.1:8080

*npm is a dependency manager it will download the depencies you need set inside the package.json
We run npm install once, then we can npm run dev each time we use
To build your website with npm run build

Working file are inside src

 Note : 
- script.js is the root file and it will be added to the HTML automatically no need to 
Insert in script
- style.css is loaded through script.js
